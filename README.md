Data Analysis &amp; Visualization scripts written for research projects in the Decision Neuroscience Lab at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology.

I was the only undergraduate researcher working on two separate projects during the summer semester of 2017. I worked in the Decision Neuroscience Lab at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, an affiliate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I will receive a co-author credit on both studies if and when they are published.

The lab's focus is to investigate the nature of human intelligence through psychology, neuroscience, and computation. The first project I worked on was entitled "Nutritional Enhancement of Cognitive and Physical Performance in Active Duty Air Force Personnel". The second project was more of a personal project for my Post-Doc and I. It was a Cognitive Chronobiology study, researching the effects of time of day and Circadian Rhythms on cognitive abilities.

I have ommitted the data files from the import statements in the scripts for confidentiality purposes and to protect the lab's research.
